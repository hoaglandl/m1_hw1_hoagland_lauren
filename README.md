I only had a small issue trying to merge the test branch with the main branch, but I quickly figured out that VS Code wanted me to confirm the merge first and once I clicked OK, it worked out. I'm not sure if there is a setting to bypass this every time I want to merge branches in the future, but it might end up saving me at times. I liked interacting with github in real time while working on the assignment. Before, I had only uploaded when projects were completed. I think this will really help me if I need to save projects to github and work on them on another computer.

I used this link to try merging branches through github and the pull requests feature, but also found a way to make it work using the git terminal as well.
